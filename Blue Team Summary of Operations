Network Topology
The following machines were identified on the network:
Host Machine
Operating System: Windows 10
Purpose: Network Host
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Capstone
Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
Purpose: LTS Server
IP Address: 192.168.1.105
ELK     	
Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
Purpose: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) Stack for logging the network
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Kali
Operating System: Kali Linux
Purpose: Attacker Machine
IP Address: 192.168.1.90
Target 1            	
Operating System: Debian Linux
Purpose: Web Server
IP Address: 192.168.1.110
Target 2            	
Operating System: Debian Linux
Purpose: Web Server
IP Address: 192.168.1.115
Description of Targets
The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110)
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. Other open ports include 111, 139, 445.
Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
Excessive HTTP Errors
Excessive HTTP Errors is implemented as follows:
Metric: packetbeat
Threshold: More than 400 HTTP errors in the past 5 minutes
Vulnerability Mitigated: This alert helps identify brute force attacks
Reliability: It is highly unlikely for this alert to generate any false positives and it is highly reliable
HTTP Request Size Monitor
HTTP Request Size Monitor is implemented as follows:
Metric: packetbeat
Threshold: HTTP requests exceeding 3500 bytes for the last 1 minute
Vulnerability Mitigated: Identifies DDOS attacks
Reliability: This alert is of a medium reliability and shouldn’t generate many if any false positives
CPU Usage Monitor
CPU Usage Monitor is implemented as follows:
Metric: metricbeat
Threshold: Will fire if the CPU is above 50% utilization for 5 minutes
Vulnerability Mitigated: excessive CPU usage/ poor resource management
Reliability: This alert is of a high reliability and shouldn’t generate any false positives
